Ceasar Salad Dressing

Ingredients

    2 small garlic cloves, minced
    1 teaspoon anchovy paste (found near the tuna fish in the supermarket)
    2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
    1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (I like the brand Maille)
    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
    1 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's Real
    1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Instructions

    In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
