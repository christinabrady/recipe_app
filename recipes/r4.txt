Quinoa Salad with Black Beans, Corn, and Tomatoes


Ingredients

    1 cup uncooked quinoa, well rinsed
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2 cups water
    1/3 cup diced red onion
    2 Tbsp lime juice
    1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
    1 cup frozen corn, defrosted, OR 1 cup of fresh corn, parboiled, drained and cooled (approximately the amount of kernels from one ear of corn)
    3 medium tomatoes, seeded and cut into chunks
    5 ounces Queso fresco, Queso Panela, fresh Mozzarella or other mild farmer's cheese, cut into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes
    1 jalape√±o, seeded and finely chopped
    1/4 cup chopped cilantro, including tender stems, packed
    3 Tbsp olive oil

instructions

1 Put the rinsed quinoa, salt and water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer gently until the quinoa absorbs all the water, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Place into a large bowl and fluff up with a fork to help it cool more quickly.

2 While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the rest of the salad. Soak the red onions in the lime juice and set aside. Soaking the onions in lime juice (or lemon juice or water) helps take the edge off of them. Mix the prepped black beans, corn kernels, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, cilantro, and oil into a large bowl.

3 When the quinoa has cooled, mix it into the bean mixture. Add the red onion and the lime juice and add salt, more oil or lime juice to taste. Serve at room temperature.
