name
Parsley, beetroot and black quinoa salad

ingredients
8 small (or 4 medium) beetroots, scrubbed clean but skin left on
3 tbsp olive oil
150g black quinoa, rinsed
100g parsley, finely chopped
15g mint, shredded
5 spring onions, finely chopped
½ medium cucumber, cut in half lengthways, then cut widthways into thin slices
2 tsp nigella seeds
1 tsp allspice
2 lemons, skin, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely chopped
Salt

For the dressing:
1 clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
2 green chillies, deseeded and roughly chopped
2 tbsp olive oil

instructions
Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. To make the dressing, crush the garlic and chilli in a pestle and mortar with half a teaspoon of salt. Slowly pour in the oil, crushing all the while, until you have a thick dressing, and set aside.

Mix the beetroot with a tablespoon of oil and spread out on a medium baking tray. Roast for 40-50 minutes, until a knife goes through smoothly, remove and, once cool enough to handle, don’t peel them, but cut into quarters if small, or 2cm-wide wedges.

Cover the quinoa with plenty of water and bring to the boil. Stir once, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes, until cooked but still retaining a bite. Drain, refresh under running water and set aside to dry well.

Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl and add the herbs, spring onion, cucumber, spices and lemon flesh. Pour over the dressing and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Mix together and then spread out on a large platter. Dot the beetroot on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve.
