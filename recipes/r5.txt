Black Rice, Corn and Cranberries

Ingredients

    1 cup black rice or wild rice
    3 tablespoons olive oil or other healthy vegetable oil
    3 to 4 cloves garlic, minced
    3 to 4 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced
    2 cups thawed frozen corn kernels
    ¼ cup lemon or lime juice, or to taste
    ¼ to ½ cup chopped cilantro leaves, to taste
    2 teaspoons ground cumin
    ½ teaspoon dried oregano
    ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
    ½ cup dried cranberries
    Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
    ¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds for topping

instructions

    If using black rice, combine in a saucepan with 2 cups water. Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently until the water is absorbed, about 30 minutes. If you’d like a more tender grain, add 1/2 cup additional water and cook until absorbed. If using wild rice, combine with 3 cups of water and cook as directed above.
    Just before the rice is done, heat half the oil in a large skillet. Add the garlic and sauté over low heat until golden. Add the scallions and corn kernels and sauté just until warmed through.
    Transfer the cooked rice to the skillet. Turn the heat up to medium-high, then add the lime juice, cilantro, cumin, oregano, thyme, cranberries, and remaining oil. Gently stir the mixture, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
    To serve, transfer to an attractive serving platter and sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over the top.
